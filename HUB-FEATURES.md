## Architecture overview

**Frontend.** Plain static HTML/CSS/JS, no build step. Every page is fully self-contained — open one in a browser and it works. The hub is deployed by uploading the files to a static host (currently the production deploy at `creatorhub.eggieweggie.ca`).

**Backend.** [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project ID `okrheyotpypulweedhda`. Hardcoded URL + anon key in every page that talks to the database. Provides:

- **Auth** — passwordless magic-link OTP.
- **Postgres + RLS** — every table has Row-Level Security policies enforcing who can read/write what.
- **Realtime** — `postgres_changes` subscriptions sync the UI live when data changes.
- **Storage** — single bucket `planner-files`, 5 GB per file, organized as `{owner_id}/{item_id}/`.

**The three roles.** Every database policy answers "is this user an **owner**, **editor**, or **manager** of the row in question?"

| Role | How they're identified | What they can do |
|---|---|---|
| **Owner** | `user_id = auth.uid()` | Full access to their own data. |
| **Editor** | `assignee_email = auth.email()` (lowercase) | Read items assigned to them. Update status (within `EDITOR_STATUSES`), notes, and upload attachments. Read the brand kit of any creator who's assigned them work. |
| **Manager** | `planner_is_manager_of(owner_id)` returns true (helper checks `planner_managers` for a claimed, non-revoked row) | Acts as the owner. Full CRUD on items, editors, brand kit, todos, storage. Can't manage *other* managers — that's owner-only. |

**Why three roles?** Owners do everything. Editors are scoped to specific items. Managers are like "co-owner with an off-switch" — they get the full hub but can be revoked at any moment.

**Magic-link auth.** Every page with sign-in calls `sb.auth.signInWithOtp({email, options:{emailRedirectTo: window.location.href}})`. The email landing page redirects back, and `sb.auth.onAuthStateChange` picks up the session. Magic links don't work under `file://` (browsers block them) — use a local server or just hit the deployed site.

**Email normalization.** `auth.email()` from Supabase is **always lowercase**. So everything that writes `assignee_email` or `planner_managers.email` must `.trim().toLowerCase()` before insert, and everything that reads should use `.ilike()` (or backfill old data to lowercase). See [the email-normalization rule](#the-email-normalization-rule) below for full detail.

**The look-and-feel system.** Every HTML page defines the same `:root` CSS variables (see [Brand & visual system](#brand--visual-system)). Cards are frosted (`rgba(255,255,255,0.85)` + `backdrop-filter:blur(14px)`). Headings use Pacifico with gradient text. Backgrounds use multi-stop radial gradients (pink → mint → periwinkle).

---

## Data model reference

All tables live in the Supabase `public` schema unless noted. RLS is on for every table.

### `planner_items` — content cards

The core table. Every video / project / piece of content is one row.

Key columns: `id`, `user_id` (the owner), `title`, `status` (`idea` / `script` / `recording` / `editing` / `scheduled` / `posted` / `archived`), `is_priority`, `platforms[]`, `assignee_email`, `deadline_at`, `posted_at`, `hook`, `script`, `hashtags`, `thumbnail_url`, `footage_url`, `editor_files_url`, `editor_notes`, `additional_assets` (JSONB array of `{label, url}`), `attachments` (JSONB array of storage paths), `notes`, `position` (kanban ordering), `analyzer_score`, `analyzer_url`.

**RLS:**
- Owners: full access to their own rows.
- Editors: SELECT + UPDATE rows where `lower(assignee_email) = auth.email()`.
- Managers: full access via `planner_is_manager_of(user_id)`.

### `planner_editors` — Eggie's editor roster

One row per editor the creator has added. Identity is owned by the creator.

Key columns: `id`, `user_id` (creator), `name`, `email` (lowercase), `color`, `notes`.

**RLS:** owners full; editors can SELECT/UPDATE their own row (matched by email); managers full.

### `planner_brand_kit` — branding bundle

One row per creator. Bundles images, video references, asset folder links, notes.

Key columns: `user_id` (PK), `branding_images` (JSONB array of `{url, label}`), `video_references` (JSONB array), `asset_folders` (JSONB array), `notes`.

**RLS:** owner full; editor can SELECT the brand kit of any creator who has assigned them an item; manager full.

### `planner_todos` — task list

Customizable todos with recurrence, subtasks, planner-item linking.

Key columns: `id`, `user_id`, `title`, `bucket` (`today` / `week` / `later` / `done`), `category_id`, `is_priority`, `due_at`, `estimate_minutes`, `repeat_type` (`none` / `daily` / `weekdays` / `weekly` / `monthly` / `custom`), `repeat_days[]`, `subtasks` (JSONB), `tags[]`, `linked_item_id` (FK to `planner_items`), `notes`, `completed_at`.

**RLS:** owners full; managers full; editors can SELECT todos linked to items they're assigned to.

### `planner_todo_categories` — todo categories

Key columns: `id`, `user_id`, `name`, `icon`, `color`.

### `planner_focus_sessions` — pomodoro log

Powers the focus-timer streak.

Key columns: `id`, `user_id`, `todo_id` (nullable), `started_at`, `ended_at`, `duration_minutes`, `completed` (bool).

### `planner_managers` — manager delegation

The roster of people the creator has invited to manage their hub.

Key columns: `id`, `owner_id` (the creator delegating), `email` (lowercase, **nullable** for open invites), `name`, `token` (UUID for the invite link), `claimed_at`, `revoked_at`, `last_seen_at`.

**RLS:** owner manages their own roster. A user can SELECT/UPDATE rows where `lower(email) = auth.email()` AND `email IS NOT NULL` (so open invites don't leak through normal reads — they only come through the peek RPC).

### `planner_client_profiles` — manager's per-client notes

The manager's private take on each creator they manage. The creator never sees this.

Key columns: `manager_user_id`, `owner_id`, `display_name` (manager's override of the creator's email), `color`, `private_notes`, `pinned`. Composite PK.

**RLS:** strictly self-only — the manager who owns the row reads/writes it. Insert additionally requires an active manager delegation for that owner.

### `planner_comments` — polymorphic threads

Comments on planner items AND todos, with role tagging.

Key columns: `id`, `parent_type` (`item` / `todo`), `parent_id`, `author_user_id`, `author_email`, `author_role` (`owner` / `manager` / `editor`), `body`, `created_at`.

**RLS:**
- Owners + managers: read everything on their data.
- Editors: read item-comments only on items they're assigned to.
- Insert role tagging is enforced server-side — you can only post as a role you actually hold.
- Authors can update/delete their own; owners/managers can delete any (moderation).

### `planner_habits_state` — habits sync

One row per user; the entire habits state is a single JSONB blob mirrored from localStorage.

Key columns: `user_id` (PK), `habits` (JSONB), `logs` (JSONB), `settings` (JSONB).

**RLS:** owner-only.

### `analyzer_user_prefs` — analyzer onboarding + bias

Drives the analyzer's recommendation weighting.

Key columns: `user_id` (PK), `sticky_tags[]`, `blocked_tags[]`, `niche_primary`, `niche_secondary`, `vtuber_type`, `content_forms[]`, `voice_tone[]`, `target_audience`, `platforms[]`, `goals[]`, `topic_synonyms` (JSONB), `candidate_tags[]`, `onboarded_at`.

**RLS:** owner-only.

### `analyzer_runs` — saved analyses

One row per saved analyzer run.

### `analyzer_title_ratings` / `analyzer_tag_ratings` — feedback for learning

Thumbs-up/down on suggested titles and tags. Feeds back into recommendation weights.

### `analyzer_trends` — shared trends cache

The only analyzer table that's NOT owner-only. Readable by anyone signed in; written by a scheduled job pulling VidIQ keyword data.

### Storage bucket: `planner-files`

5 GB per file cap. Folder convention: `{owner_id}/{item_id}/<filename>`.

**Policy:** owner has all; editors can read + upload into folders for items they're assigned to; managers full (after regex-validating the first path segment is a valid UUID — prevents non-UUID folder names from triggering unintended access).

### SECURITY DEFINER RPCs

| RPC | Caller | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `planner_manager_peek_invite(token)` | anon + auth | Returns invite preview (creator email, locked email, claimed/revoked flags, `is_open`). Anon-callable so the claim page can confirm the link before sign-in. |
| `planner_manager_claim_invite(token)` | auth | Enforces email-lock match. Idempotent. Handles three open-invite edge cases (no existing row → bind email; existing active → touch last_seen + drop the open row; existing revoked → reject). |
| `planner_list_my_delegations()` | auth | Returns active delegations for the current user (powers manager-hub + planner.html's hub-picker). |
| `planner_is_manager_of(uuid)` | (helper used inside RLS) | Returns true if `auth.email()` matches an active row in `planner_managers` for that owner_id. |

---

## `index.html` — hub homepage

**Purpose.** The first thing people land on. Brand hero, six tool tiles, personalized welcome card when signed in.

**Who can use it.** Anyone. Signed-in users get the welcome card + habits widget (only renders if `localStorage.eggie.habits.v1` has data).

**Layout.**
- Fixed top-right **auth pill** (`#siteAuthPill`) → opens `#siteAuthModal`. Signed-in label is "🐙 <username>".
- Top utility row: `👑 Manager Hub` pill → `manager-hub.html`.
- Hero: brand logotype PNG + `hero-chibi.png` mascot (with `gentle-bob` animation) + Pacifico gradient headline.
- Welcome card (`#welcomeCard`, hidden until signed in) with "Sign out" button.
- Habits widget (`#habitsWidget`): today's done / week total / longest streak / progress bar, "Open tracker →" link. Reads `localStorage.eggie.habits.v1`; allows 1 missed day before breaking a streak.
- 6 tool tiles with hover translate-Y + CTA pills:
  1. **Shorts Analyzer** → `analyzer.html`
  2. **Growth Playbook** → `growth.html`
  3. **Thumbnail Checker** → `thumbnail.html`
  4. **Content Planner** → `planner.html`
  5. **Sustainable Habits** → `habits.html`
  6. **To-Do List** → `todo.html`
- "More tools coming" section listing 5 future ideas (sustainable schedule quiz, bio/branding workshop, sponsor pitch builder, debut prep checklist, niche discovery quiz).
- About-Eggie strip + Twitter link.
- Support row: Ko-fi button + `@EggieWeggieVT` Twitter pill.

**Auth flow.** Sign-in here propagates to every other tool via `sb.auth.getSession()`.

**DB touch.** None — only `sb.auth`. Reads `localStorage.eggie.habits.v1`.

---

## `planner.html` — the creator's main planner

**The big one.** 5,500+ lines. Eggie's content workspace.

**Who can use it.** Signed-in creators (own hub). Managers via `?manage=<manager_id>` URL — flips the page into impersonation mode.

### Top-level layout

- Back-row links: Hub / Editor view / Tasks / Habits / Playbook / About.
- `#authView` — magic-link sign-in card (shown when signed out).
- `#appView` — everything when signed in:
  - **User bar** — email, connection dot, `#hubPickerBtn` (only visible if `planner_list_my_delegations()` returns ≥1 row), `#signOutBtn`.
  - **Impersonation banner** (`#impersonationBanner`) — shown when `?manage=<id>` is set. "Exit manager mode" button restores you to your own hub.
  - **Todo widget** (`#todoWidget`) — embedded mini-todo. Quick-add input, today's tasks, streak chip, collapse toggle, "Open full to-do →" link to `todo.html`.
  - **Toolbar** — `+ New item`, `👥 Editors`, `👑 Managers`, `🎨 Brand kit`, `🎙️ Stream schedule`, view-toggle (📋 Kanban / 📑 List / 📆 Calendar), editor filter, form-type pills (📱 Short / 📺 Long / ⭐ Important), search.
  - **Kanban view** — 7 status columns. Drag-drop reorders via the `position` column. "archived" hidden by default.
  - **Calendar view** — month grid with prev/next/today, legend (item deadline / item posted / stream slot recurring).
  - **List view** — table: Title / Status / Platforms / Assignee / Deadline.

### Item modal (`#itemModal`)

The full editor for a single content item. Opens via `+ New item` or clicking a card.

Fields:
- Title + ⭐ priority checkbox.
- Status select (7 options).
- Editor select (populated from `planner_editors`).
- Platform pills (YT Shorts / YT Long / TikTok / IG / X / Twitch).
- Deadline + Posted datetime.
- Hook, Script (with `🎬 Recording mode` button → teleprompter), Hashtags.
- Thumbnail URL, Footage URL, Editor output URL.
- File uploads (5 GB cap each) → Supabase Storage `planner-files/{owner_id}/{item_id}/`.
- Additional assets — dynamic labeled link rows (`+ Add asset link`).
- **Quick title score** inline panel (calls the analyzer engine on the title as you type) + `Open full analyzer` button (passes title via URL param).
- Analyzer score + Analyzer link (when saved from analyzer.html).
- Notes.
- **Comments thread** — role-tagged (`authorRole()` returns `manager` when impersonating, `owner` otherwise).
- Delete / Cancel / Save buttons.

### Editors modal (`#editorsModal`)

Manage the editor roster.

- Editor list with per-row actions: Copy link / Preview / Edit / Remove.
- Identity section (creator-managed): name, email, color swatch.
- Generated invite link block with `📋 Copy` + `↗ Open`.
- Note pointing editors to the brand kit.

### Managers modal (`#managersModal`)

Manage the manager roster.

- Manager list with per-row actions: Copy link / Revoke / Delete.
- Invite form: name, optional email.
- **Email blank = open invite** — anyone signed in can claim. Roster status pill says "open link" until claimed; afterwards shows the bound email.
- Generates locked or open invite link with Copy/Open.

### Other modals

- **Editor preview** (`#editorPreviewModal`) — opens `planner-editor.html` for any editor row inside an iframe. Useful for "what does my editor actually see?"
- **View modal** (`#viewModal`) — read-only item detail (quick status, ⭐ star, Edit / Record / Close / Delete).
- **Brand kit modal** (`#brandKitModal`) — branding images grid + list (with image upload), video reference links, asset folder links, notes textarea. "Save brand kit" persists to `planner_brand_kit`.
- **Stream schedule modal** (`#streamScheduleModal`) — 7-day grid (Sun-Sat) with recurring slots (start, end, title, color from `STREAM_COLORS`).

### Teleprompter overlay (`#teleprompterOverlay`)

Fullscreen script reader. Keyboard controls:

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| Space | Play/pause |
| R | Restart |
| ↑ / ↓ | Speed up/down |
| + / − | Font size up/down |
| Esc | Close |

Speed slider 0.3-6×, font size 20-80, mirror toggle.

### Realtime sync

| Channel | Watches | Filter |
|---|---|---|
| `planner_items_realtime` | `planner_items` | `user_id = currentOwnerId` |
| `planner_editors_realtime` | `planner_editors` | `user_id = currentOwnerId` |
| `planner_managers_realtime` | `planner_managers` | `owner_id = currentUser.id` (**not** ownerId — see [currentOwnerId pattern](#the-currentownerid-pattern)) |
| `planner_todos_widget` | `planner_todos` | `user_id = currentOwnerId` |

Realtime `postgres_changes` filters only support `eq`, **not** `ilike` — so data must already be lowercased for editor live updates to work.

### State variables to know

- `currentUser` — the signed-in user object.
- `currentOwnerId` — the **data owner** (`currentUser.id` when on your own hub, OR the delegating creator's UUID when impersonating).
- `impersonating` — boolean. True when `?manage=<id>` is in URL.
- `managerDelegations` — array from `planner_list_my_delegations()`.
- `formFilter`, `priorityOnly` — toolbar state.

See [the currentOwnerId pattern](#the-currentownerid-pattern) below for the critical rule about when to use which.

### Tables touched

`planner_items`, `planner_editors`, `planner_managers`, `planner_client_profiles` (read for manager display names), `planner_comments`, `planner_brand_kit`, `planner_todos`, `planner_todo_categories`. RPCs: `planner_list_my_delegations`. Storage: `planner-files`.

## `planner-editor.html` — editor dashboard

**Purpose.** Editor-facing read/limited-write view. Brand kit + assigned items grouped into Ready / In progress / Done.

**Who can use it.** Anyone signed in via magic link, with an email a creator has added to their editor roster.

### Layout

- Back-row: Hub / Planner (creator view).
- `#authView` with **personalized welcome banner** — fills creator's chosen name from `?name=` URL param.
- `#appView`:
  - User bar (email + connection dot + Sign out).
  - **Brand kit card** (`#brandKitCard`) — shown to every editor on every project they're assigned to. Branding images, editing-style videos, asset folder links, creator's notes. Collapsible.
  - **App grid:** profile column (read-only — identity managed by creator) + tasks column.
  - **Project list** grouped:
    - 🌟 Ready to work on
    - 🛠️ In progress
    - ✅ Done

Each project card shows: status pills, platform pills, deadline, hook, script preview, footage/editor file links, additional assets, attachment download links, editor notes editor (`💾 Save notes`), status-transition buttons.

### `EDITOR_STATUSES`

Editors can only transition into: `recording`, `editing`, `scheduled`. Final `posted` ship is creator-only.

### Query filter

Reads `planner_items` filtered by `.ilike('assignee_email', currentUser.email)` for backward compat with legacy mis-cased data. The RLS policy is strict-equal on the DB side — for full backward compat, lowercase old rows OR use a `lower(...)` policy. See [email-normalization rule](#the-email-normalization-rule).

### Realtime

`editor-items-realtime` channel — but realtime filters can't use `.ilike`, so live updates require data to already be lowercase.

---

## `manager-hub.html` — universal manager dashboard

**Purpose.** Lists every creator who's delegated co-owner access to the signed-in user.

**Who can use it.** Anyone signed in. Empty state if no delegations — pointer to "ask the creator for an invite" or `➕ Add a client` panel.

### Layout

- Back-row: Hub / Own planner.
- `#authView` — magic-link sign-in.
- `#dashboardView`:
  - User bar: email + `➕ Add a client` / `🔄 Refresh` / `Sign out`.
  - **Add-client panel** — paste an invite URL or token; auto-extracts `?token=` from a pasted URL and calls the claim RPC.
  - **Summary bar** — 5 stats: Clients / Active projects / Next 7 days / In editing / Recent editor notes.
  - **Clients grid** — one card per delegation.

### Client card

- 👑 crown avatar, display name (manager's override OR creator's email), pin star.
- Status count row (7 columns matching `STATUS_DEFS`).
- Active project count + "last update" relative time.
- **Attention block** — "scheduled this week / stuck in editing >5d / new editor notes" OR "✓ All clear".
- **Expandable client profile + private notes** — display name override + private notes textarea, auto-save 700 ms debounced, "🔒 only you see it" warning.
- `Open hub` button → `planner.html?manage=<manager_id>`.
- `Editor view` button.

### Sorting

Pinned first, then by `claimed_at desc`.

### Tables

`planner_client_profiles`, `planner_items` (read via manager RLS). RPCs: `planner_manager_peek_invite`, `planner_manager_claim_invite`, `planner_list_my_delegations`.

### Error case

If `planner_client_profiles` doesn't exist (relation missing), the page shows: "Run `planner-manager-hub-v2.sql` first".

---

## `manager-claim.html` — invite claim landing

**Purpose.** Landing page for `?token=…` invite links. Confirms invite, prompts sign-in, claims, redirects.

**Who can use it.** Anyone with the link. Locked invites require sign-in with the specified email; open invites accept any email.

### Views

Toggled by `.hidden` class:

1. `#loadingView` — initial peek lookup.
2. `#inviteView` — shows creator name + perks list + `🔒 locked to <email>` OR `🔓 open invite` block + email input (readonly if locked) + `📬 Send magic link`.
3. `#claimView` — after magic-link return: "Signed in as <email>" + `👑 Claim manager access` + "Use a different account" sign-out fallback.
4. `#successView` — "🎉 You're in!" + auto-redirect to `planner.html?manage=<manager_id>` after 1.4 s.
5. `#errorView` — bad/revoked/missing token + "Try a different account" button.

### Magical auto-claim

If the user is already signed in with an email that matches the locked invite (or it's open), the page auto-advances `inviteView` → `claimView` → `successView` without needing the magic-link round-trip. Feels seamless.

### Backward compatibility

Uses `!!peek.is_open || !peek.email` to detect open invites — degrades gracefully when the `planner-managers-open-invites.sql` migration hasn't been run yet (treats every locked invite normally).

### RPCs only

No direct table writes. `planner_manager_peek_invite` (anon-safe) + `planner_manager_claim_invite` (auth).

---

## `todo.html` — customizable todo list

3,100+ lines. Sister tool to the planner.

**Who can use it.** Signed-in creators (own list). Managers can read/write via RLS.

### Layout

- Back-row links (current = ✓ Tasks).
- `#authView` — magic-link.
- `#appView`:
  - User bar.
  - **Stats row** (`#statsRow`) — dynamic.
  - **End-of-day review banner** (`#reviewBanner`) — "X done today, Open review / Later".
  - **Quick-add bar** with inline shortcut support:
    - `#tag` adds a tag
    - `!today` / `!week` / `!later` sets the bucket
    - Trailing `!` flags priority
    - Category select, bucket select, ⭐ toggle, Add button
  - **Quick-add helper** (`#qaHelper`) — collapsible examples panel.
  - **Toolbar:** search, category filter, filter pills (⭐ Priority / 🚨 Overdue / 🔁 Recurring / 🔗 Linked), view toggle (📋 Board / 📃 List / 📍 Today), 🎨 Categories button, 🌙 Review button.
  - **Board view** (`#boardView`) — 4 columns: Today / This Week / Later / Done. "+ Add task" inline per column.
  - **List view** + **Today-only view**.
- Bottom floating **focus FAB** + **focus dock** (mini timer) + fullscreen **focus overlay**.

### Editor modal (`#editorModal`)

Full task editor. Fields: title, bucket, category, priority, due datetime, estimate minutes, **Repeat** (`none` / `daily` / `weekdays` / `weekly` / `monthly` / `custom`), notes, **subtasks** list, **tags**, **link to planner item** search picker, **comments** thread, Delete / Start focus / Cancel / Save.

### Categories modal (`#catsModal`)

Category CRUD: name, icon emoji, color swatch picker.

### Review modal (`#reviewModal`)

Daily review: stats grid, weekly bar chart, completed-today list, "Roll forward" pending list, Roll all into tomorrow.

### Focus timer

- Default 25-min pomodoro.
- Pop-out into a floating Document Picture-in-Picture window (with popup fallback).
- Pause / Skip / Pop out / Minimize / End session.
- Sessions logged to `planner_focus_sessions` — streak counter reads from here.

### Recurrence

On completion, recurring tasks spawn a fresh row scheduled per their pattern.

### Tables

`planner_todos`, `planner_todo_categories`, `planner_focus_sessions`, `planner_items` (read for link picker), `planner_comments` (item-comment thread reuse).

Realtime: `planner_todos_realtime`, `planner_todo_cats_realtime`, `planner_items_for_todos`.

### Limitation to know

todo.html doesn't yet support manager impersonation — comments posted from this page are always tagged `owner`. If/when this ships, mirror the planner.html `currentOwnerId` pattern.

## `analyzer.html` — shorts analyzer

7,600+ lines. The biggest file in the hub by a wide margin.

4. `#ebPerfModal` — log how a posted short actually performed: URL, views, likes, comments, shares, notes.

### Learning loop

Thumbs-up/down on titles + tags writes to `analyzer_title_ratings` / `analyzer_tag_ratings`, which feed back into recommendation weights for the signed-in user.

### Trends cache

Reads `trends.json` from a periodic scheduled task pulling VidIQ keyword volume + competition data. Used to bias hashtag/title suggestions toward currently-rising terms.

### Tables

`analyzer_user_prefs`, `analyzer_runs`, `analyzer_title_ratings`, `analyzer_tag_ratings`, `analyzer_trends`.

localStorage: `PROFILE_KEY` (legacy VTuber checkbox), `TEMPLATE_KEY` (description template presets).

**Purpose.** The master long-form reference behind everything the analyzer scores. Rules, thresholds, tactics.

**Who can use it.** Anyone. No sign-in, no database.

### 18 chapters

Each is a `<details class="growth-section">` with collapsible body:

1. 📊 How the algorithm actually works (open by default)
2. 🎯 The 3 metrics that actually matter
3. ✅ The 4-criteria content rule
4. 📺 YouTube Shorts specifics
5. 💬 Driving more comments
6. 📱 Platform-specific posting rules
7. 🏷️ The hashtag formula (built into the analyzer)
8. 🌱 Growing on Twitch (the real strategy)
9. 📝 Title strategy
10. 🗣️ Getting chatters engaged
11. 🔄 Conversion + retention
12. 💰 Monetization + sponsors (you're a virtual busker)
13. 🐦 Twitter/X for VTubers
14. 📺 Twitch deep-dive (2026 edition)
15. ⚙️ OBS Studio + Twitch setup (best quality)
16. 💸 VTuber monetization, in depth
17. 🌶️ Fansly for VTubers (18+)
18. 📚 Resources mentioned in this guide

### Behavior

- "Pick a chapter" `.growth-toc` jump-link grid at top.
- Anchor-link smooth scroll auto-opens the target `<details>` when clicked.
- Section bodies use `.callout` boxes, `.ref-list` external-link lists, and tables for structured rules.

## `habits.html` — sustainable habits tracker

**Purpose.** Spoon-theory habit tracker for VTubers/streamers. Pre-loaded with curated creator habits. Streaks pause, never reset.

**Who can use it.** Anyone (anonymous, local-first). Sign-in syncs across devices.

### Layout

- Fixed floating **auth pill** (`#authPill`).
- Back-row + hero.
- **Top dashboard** (`.dash`): today's count + label + progress bar, **energy picker** (🌙 Low / 🌤 Medium / 🌞 High — cumulative), **stream-day toggle**, **view tabs** (✓ Today / 📚 Library / 📊 Stats).
- **Today view** — categorized list of today's enabled habits with checkoff/counters.
- **Library view** — habit library with category filter pills (All / ⭐ My habits / 🌅 Pre-stream / 🎙️ On-air / 🌙 Post-stream / 📅 Content / 💬 Community / 💖 Health / 💼 Business / 🎨 Batch / 🚫 Hidden) + `+ Add custom habit`.
- **Stats view** — stat grid + 30-day heatmap + sustainability note ("Missing a day doesn't wipe your streak. It pauses.").

### Modals

1. `#authModal` — magic-link sign-in.
2. `#habitModal` — habit editor: name, emoji, category (8 options), energy cost (🟢 essential / 🟦 normal / 🌸 intensive), tracking (daily check-off / weekly target / count), target number, unit, note.

### Behavior rules

- **Energy mode is cumulative:** Low → essential only. Medium → adds normal. High → adds intensive.
- **Stream-day toggle:** on = pre-stream / on-air / post-stream categories visible; off = hidden.
- **Heatmap:** last 30 days.
- **Each category** carries a `link` field in the `CATEGORIES` const pointing to a `growth.html#anchor` so the habit tile links back to the relevant playbook chapter.

### Storage

- `localStorage.eggie.habits.v1` — full state mirror for offline-first.
- `planner_habits_state` table — one row per user keyed by `user_id` with `habits` / `logs` / `settings` JSONB columns. Sync writes the entire blob.

## `thumbnail.html` — thumbnail checker

**Purpose.** Drop a YouTube long-form or Twitch thumbnail; grade it for click-through readability across every real display size.

**Who can use it.** Anyone. No sign-in, no database, no localStorage.

### Steps

1. **Drop your thumbnail** — drop-zone, thumb preview with detection overlay + toggle, key + stats, model-loading progress panel.
2. **Tell me about your character** (`stepCharacter`) — VTuber-friendly manual checklist replacing unreliable BlazeFace auto-detection. 4 checkboxes:
   - visible
   - emotion
   - big crop
   - eyes looking at camera

   Score updates live as you tick.
3. **What it looks like on YouTube** (`step2`) — mobile + desktop multi-size preview grid.
4. **The score** (`step3`) — ring out of 10 + verdict + criteria grid.
5. **What I see in your thumbnail** (`step4`) — insight grid (text OCR, faces, focal point, contrast, colors).
6. **What to fix** (`step5`) — checklist.

### Best-practices panel

VidIQ-sourced thumbnail wisdom in collapsible `.bp-card` details (Faces with emotion / Text 2-4 words max / High contrast + saturation / etc.).

### Interactive bits

- Live re-scoring as character-checklist checkboxes change.
- OCR text editing with `↺ Restore OCR` button.
- Overlay toggle hides detection boxes.

### Why the character checklist replaces auto-detection

BlazeFace doesn't reliably detect 2D VTuber model faces. Explicit design decision: ask the user instead of guessing wrong.

### Model size

~240 MB on first run (Florence-2 OCR + helpers), cached.

---

## `about.html` — about + niche list

**Purpose.** Explains the analyzer, lists every game/genre/content-type/identity tag it knows about, and provides a contact form.

**Who can use it.** Anyone. No auth.

### Sections

- Hero + back-row.
- **What it does** card with 3 overview tiles (score, hashtags, post pack).
- **How it works** card with 4 tech-grid items (Florence-2 vision ×3 frames, Whisper-base.en transcription, frame + audio analysis, typed text as tier-1 signal).
- **The 1S/2M/2L formula** card with badge pills.
- **What's in the database** card with 4 pool sections:
  - 🎮 Games (~100 entries)
  - 🎨 Genres / topics (39 entries)
  - 📋 Content types (35 entries)
  - 🐙 Creator identity (7 entries — VTuber, EN VTuber, Streamer, Clipper, LGBTQ+, Trans, POC)
- **Growth playbook callout** → growth.html.
- **Contact card** — `mailto:` form (Name, Reply-to, Niche, Message) sending to `eggieweggievt@gmail.com`.
- **Fine print** — privacy / affiliation / cost / sharing FAQ.

## Cross-cutting patterns

These are the rules that span multiple files. They're not in one place in the code — they're enforced by convention everywhere. Get one wrong and things break silently.

### The `currentOwnerId` pattern

In `planner.html`, when a manager impersonates a creator via `?manage=<id>`, **every data operation must target the creator's UUID, not the signed-in user's UUID.**

The rule:

| Variable | When to use |
|---|---|
| `currentOwnerId` | All planner data operations: items, editors, brand kit, stream schedule, todos, storage paths. Equals `currentUser.id` when on your own hub, OR the delegating creator's UUID when impersonating. |
| `currentUser.id` | Only where the semantics are "the signed-in user's own identity" — managing your **own** manager roster, hub-picker labelling, manager-realtime subscription filter. |

If you forget this and write a new feature that uses `currentUser.id` everywhere, the manager will see/edit their *own* (empty) data instead of the creator's. The symptom is "manager mode works but shows no items".

**Roster realtime exception.** The `planner_managers_realtime` channel filters by `currentUser.id`, **not** `currentOwnerId`, because managers don't manage *other* managers — that roster always belongs to the actual signed-in creator.

### The email-normalization rule

Emails connecting editors and managers to projects flow through three places that ALL need to agree:

1. The column (`planner_items.assignee_email` or `planner_managers.email`).
2. The client-side query filter.
3. The RLS policy (`assignee_email = auth.email()`).

Any mismatch in case or whitespace = the editor/manager silently sees "No projects yet" even though they were assigned.

**Why this is a recurring bug.** Supabase `auth.email()` is **always lowercase**. The JS save paths haven't always been lowercasing before writing. Old rows can have mixed-case emails.

**How to apply when touching this:**

1. **Writes** must `.trim().toLowerCase()` before insert — both `planner.html` `saveItem` (~line 4337) and `saveEditor` (~line 2650).
2. **Reads** should use `.ilike()` not `.eq()` for backward compat with legacy mis-cased data — see `planner-editor.html` `loadProjects`.
3. **RLS** is strict-equal on the DB side and can't be bypassed by client-side `.ilike()`. For full backward compat, either:
   - (a) **Backfill** — preferred: `update planner_items set assignee_email = lower(trim(assignee_email))`. Keeps the policy indexable.
   - (b) **Change the policy** to `lower(assignee_email) = lower(auth.email())`.
4. **Realtime `postgres_changes` filters only support `eq`, not `ilike`.** Live updates rely on data being lowercased correctly. There is no client-side workaround.

When debugging "editor can't see projects": check all three places. The chain is `planner.html save` → `assignee_email` column → editor-side query + RLS. They must all normalize consistently.

### Adding a new manager-accessible table

If you add a new table that should also be accessible to managers, add an additive RLS policy mirroring the pattern at the bottom of `planner-managers.sql`:

```sql
create policy "managers manage <table>" on public.<table>
  for all
  using (planner_is_manager_of(user_id))
  with check (planner_is_manager_of(user_id));
```

Existing owner/editor policies stay untouched — manager access is purely additive.

### Storage policy regex

The storage policy for `planner-files` regex-checks that the first path segment is a valid UUID **before** calling `planner_is_manager_of()`. This prevents non-UUID folder names from triggering unintended access. If you add a new bucket or change the folder convention, mirror this regex check.

### Brand kit visibility

The `planner_brand_kit` RLS policy lets an **editor read the brand kit of any creator who has assigned them an item**. This is intentional — editors need brand context to make on-brand cuts. If you add a new brand-related table, mirror this "editor reads if assigned to any item from this creator" pattern.

## Brand & visual system

Every page defines the same `:root` CSS variables. Use these — never hardcode hex values.

### Color palette

| Variable | Value | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `--pink-hot` | `#FFB2F0` | Primary hot pink |
| `--blue` | `#63AAF4` | Accent blue |
| `--mint` | `#6BE4EA` | Accent mint/teal |
| `--pink-light` | `#FFDBF7` | Soft pink |
| `--periwinkle` | `#90A5FF` | Purple-blue accent |
| `--deep` | `#4D5BC0` | Deep indigo (headings, buttons, body links) |
| `--ink` | `#3a2a5a` | Body text |
| `--ink-soft` | `#6b5f8a` | Secondary text |
| `--white` | `#ffffff` | White |

### Editor / category palette

Used in `planner.html` editor swatches, `todo.html` categories, `habits.html` modal:

```
#FFB2F0, #FF8AA8, #FFB07A, #FFD27A, #A8E6BE, #6BE4EA,
#90A5FF, #C9A8FF, #FFB2C8, #3FB8C0, #4D5BC0, #a23556
```

### Stream-slot palette

First 8 of the above.

### Fonts

- **Pacifico** — cursive display. `.logo`, `h1/h2/h3`, tile titles. **Important:** Pacifico has long descenders + swooshes. Headings need generous `line-height` + bottom padding or the bottoms of `y` / `g` get clipped, especially with `background-clip:text`.
- **Quicksand** (400/500/600/700/800) — body, UI, buttons, inputs.
- Fallback: `system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif`.

### Signature visual treatments

- Multi-stop radial gradient backgrounds (top-left pink → top-right mint → bottom periwinkle) on a `linear-gradient(180deg, #fef0fb, #eaf2ff, #e7fbfc)` base.
- `body::before` sparkle layer: 5-6 white radial-gradient dots scattered across the page.
- **Frosted cards:** `rgba(255,255,255,0.78-0.85)` + `backdrop-filter:blur(14px)` + soft shadow `0 8px 32px rgba(99,170,244,0.18)`.
- **Heading gradient text:** linear-gradient pink-hot → periwinkle → mint, clipped to text via `background-clip:text`.
- Pacifico headings on `border-radius:24px` (`--radius`) cards.
- **Pill-style buttons** (`border-radius:999px`) everywhere.
- Hero mascot: `hero-chibi.png` with `gentle-bob` keyframe (6 s ease-in-out).
- Octopus 🐙 = mascot signifier throughout brand voice.

### Brand asset files in the folder

- `EGGIE LOGOTYPE - BORDER.png` — wordmark
- `BADGE 1.png`, `BADGE 2.png` — favicons / badges
- `accent.png` — small octopus accent (inline in analyzer logo)
- `PATTERN 1.png`, `PATTERN 2.png` — background patterns
- `DD1.png`, `DD3.png` — additional design assets
- `preview.png` — OG / Twitter card image
- `hero-chibi.png`, `tile-analyzer.png`, `tile-growth.png`, `tile-thumbnail.png`, `tile-planner.png`, `tile-habits.png`, `tile-todo.png`, `eggie-portrait.png` — tile + portrait slots (with emoji `onerror` fallbacks)

## Template: "add a new feature here"

Copy this whenever you ship a new feature, modal, page, or table. Paste it under the relevant page's section (or at the bottom of this file if it's brand new), fill the blanks, link to any SQL migration.

```markdown
### <Feature name>

**Shipped:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Lives in:** `<file>.html` (around `<section/modal/function name>`)
**Migration:** `<sql-file.sql>` if any, otherwise "no schema changes"

**Purpose.** One sentence — what does this do for the user?

**Who can use it.** Owner only / editors / managers / anyone signed in / anonymous.

**How it works.**
- UI: where it lives in the page, what buttons/modals it adds.
- Data: what tables/columns it reads/writes, what RLS rules apply.
- Realtime: any new channels or filters?
- Storage: any new bucket folders or path conventions?

**Gotchas / things future-you needs to remember.** If you change X, also change Y. If you forget Z, the symptom is W.

**Cross-references.** If this feature interacts with [the currentOwnerId pattern](#the-currentownerid-pattern), [email normalization](#the-email-normalization-rule), or any other cross-cutting rule, link to it here.

**Also update:**
- [ ] `README.md` "Map of the site" table (if it's a new page) or "I just want to…" jump-links (if it's a top-level user action)
- [ ] The relevant `Tables touched` section above
- [ ] Memory bookmark in your collaborator's notes if it has a silent-failure gotcha
```

### Version log

Append to this when something big ships. Keep it short — date + one-liner + which migration if any.

- **2026-05-27** — V3.3 Open invites. `planner-managers-open-invites.sql`. Manager invite emails are now optional; blank email = any-email-can-claim link.
- **2026-05-27** — V3.2 Manager hub redux. `planner-manager-hub-v2.sql`. Per-client profiles + private notes + polymorphic comments on items/todos. Homepage now has a `👑 Manager Hub` pill button.
- **2026-05-27** — V3 Manager delegation. `planner-managers.sql`. Full co-owner delegation via email-locked invite links with the `planner_is_manager_of()` RLS helper.
- **2026-05-27** — V2.14 Email-normalization fix. Lowercased writes everywhere; `.ilike()` reads for backward compat.
